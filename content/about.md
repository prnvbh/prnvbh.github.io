👋🏻 Hi, I’m Pranav.

I'm a second-year Electrical Engineering student at Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh. I like to build stuff.

## Work

 Most of my work includes building real stuff that have been used by people. As part of the implementation body of the ACM club at my college, I have contributed to various initiatives and developed software that is actively used by students.
 
 I am also passionate about sharing my knowledge and frequently educate my peers about various technologies I have learned.
 I have also participated in various hackathons, where I worked on innovative projects and collaborated with talented individuals. 

My primary interests lie in Artificial Intelligence, distributed systems, and building complex backend systems.
